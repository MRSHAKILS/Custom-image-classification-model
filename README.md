# 🖼️ Custom Image Classification Model

Welcome to the Custom Image Classification Model project!  
This repository is designed to guide you through building your own image classifier that distinguishes between five adorable and fascinating animal classes: **Dog, Cow, Cat, Lamb, and Zebra**.

## 🌟 What is this all about?

Ever wondered how machine learning models can tell animals apart in photos? This project takes you from collecting your own dataset to building a robust classifier that can identify animals with at least **90% accuracy**. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to polish your ML skills, this repo is crafted for you.

## 🚀 Features

- **Custom Dataset**: Gather 100 images for each class (dog, cow, cat, lamb, zebra) from the internet or your own camera.
- **Step-by-Step Model Building**: Clean, preprocess, and split your images, then train a neural network for image classification.
- **Performance Goal**: Achieve ≥90% accuracy in classifying the five animal classes.
- **Jupyter Notebook Workflow**: Interactive and easy-to-follow code for learning and experimentation.

## 🐾 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MRSHAKILS/Custom-image-classification-model.git
   cd Custom-image-classification-model
   ```

2. **Prepare your dataset**
   - Collect 100 images for each animal class.
   - Organize them into folders: `/data/dog`, `/data/cow`, etc.

3. **Install dependencies**
   - Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and Jupyter Notebook.
   - Install required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run the notebook**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open the main notebook and follow along!

## 🧠 How does it work?

- **Data Loading**: Images are loaded and split into training and testing sets.
- **Preprocessing**: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented for better learning.
- **Model Training**: A deep learning model (e.g., CNN) is trained using your dataset.
- **Evaluation**: The model’s accuracy is evaluated—shoot for that 90%!

## 🤗 Why try this project?

- Learn hands-on about computer vision and deep learning.
- Build your own dataset—a vital skill in real-world ML projects.
- See tangible results as your model gets smarter.
